# CodonFM: Foundation Models for Codon Sequences

CodonFM is a fully open-source suite of foundation models trained directly on codon sequences to learn contextual codon representations and enable downstream codon-aware tasks. We release the entire stack: code, training/finetuning/evaluation scripts, dockerized environments, experiment templates, and pre-trained model weights under an open license for transparent and reproducible use. 

Our primary model family, Encodon, uses masked language modeling over codons with scalable architectures (80M to 1B) and efficient memmapped data pipelines. Public links to the pre-trained checkpoints are here: [80M](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-CodonFM-Encodon-80M-v1), [600M](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-CodonFM-Encodon-600M-v1), [1B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-CodonFM-Encodon-1B-v1), [1B-Cdwt](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-CodonFM-Encodon-Cdwt-1B-v1). 

The checkpoints can also be found on NGC [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/models/nv_codonfm_encodon).

## Quickstart
To run the scripts in this repository, we recommend using the provided Docker setup.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/CodonFM
cd codon-fm
```
### 2. Docker Setup

The fastest way to get up and running with CodonFM is through the Docker setup below. This is an interactive development environment, you can build and launch a container that mounts your local repository. This allows you to edit code locally and run it inside the container.

To build and launch the development container, simply run the following from the root folder:

```bash
bash run_dev.sh
```

This script will:
1.  Build the development Docker image using the `development` target in the `Dockerfile`.
2.  Pass your user and group IDs to the container to avoid permission issues with mounted files.
3.  Stop and remove any existing container with the same name.
4.  Launch a new container with your local code mounted at `/workspace`, GPU access, host networking, and common directories for data and SSH keys.

You can also customize the data and checkpoint directory paths by passing arguments:
```bash
bash run_dev.sh --data-dir /path/to/your/data --checkpoints-dir /path/to/your/checkpoints
```

You will be dropped into a `bash` shell inside the container as a non-root user.

#### Evaluation Notebooks 📓

A series of notebooks are provided in the `notebooks` directory show casing multiple use cases such as zero-shot variant prediction and finetuning on downstream tasks. See a brief overview below:

### Data 📊

#### Pre-training Dataset

The data curation tools live under `data_scripts/data_curation/`.

- Main entrypoint: open and run `data_scripts/data_curation/download_cds_clean.ipynb`. It documents how to obtain coding sequences (CDS), process metadata, and produce curated outputs.
- Filtering resources: `data_scripts/data_curation/taxids_to_remove_bac.json` lists bacterial taxids to exclude during curation.
- Recommended environment: use the provided dev container (`bash run_dev.sh`), then open the notebook in Jupyter/VS Code and execute the cells.

Outputs from the notebook (cleaned CDS files and metadata tables) can be transformed into training-ready formats memmap creation script in `src/data/data_scripts/ncbi_memmap_dataset_batched.py` on the output of the `src/data/data_curation/` notebook. This can then be consumed by`CodonMemmapDataset`.

#### Evaluation Datasets

- mRFP expression and mRNA stability:
  - Open and run the notebooks `notebooks/5-EnCodon-Downstream-Task-mRFP-expression.ipynb` and `notebooks/6-EnCodon-Downstream-Task-mRNA-stability.ipynb`. These notebooks contain cells that download/prepare the datasets and guide you through executing the evaluations end-to-end.
- Mean translation efficiency prediction task:
  - Open and run the notebook `notebooks/4-EnCodon-Downstream-Task-riboNN.ipynb`. It will download/prepare the downstream dataset and guide you through finetuning on this downstream task.
- Synonymous, DDD/ASD, and Cancer Hotspot variant datasets:
  - Follow `notebooks/00-Mutation-Datasets-Preprocessing.ipynb`. This notebook includes a cell that lists the required input files (with expected names/locations) and outlines how to process them into harmonized formats.
  - After preprocessing, use the task-specific notebooks in `notebooks/` (e.g., `0-...CancerHotspot.ipynb` and `1-...DDD-ASD.ipynb`) which consume the harmonized outputs produced by the preprocessing notebook.

### Running Training/Finetuning/Evaluation
The main entry point is `src/runner.py` which supports three modes:
#### Pre-training

The explicit scripts used to train the released checkpoints are referenced in [Pre-trained Models](#pre-trained-models)
```bash
python -m src.runner pretrain \
    --out_dir <output_dir> \
    --exp_name <experiment_name> \
    --model_name <model_size> \
    --data_path <path_to_data> \
    --process_item mlm_memmap \
    --dataset_name CodonMemmapDataset \
    --lr <learning_rate> \
    --num_gpus <num_gpus> \
    --num_nodes <num_nodes>
```

Optional path overrides:
```bash
  --out_dir <dir>
  --checkpoints_dir <dir>
  --pretrained_ckpt_path <path>
```

**Available `--process_item` options:**
- `mlm_memmap`: Constructs MLM training examples using memory-mapped data input format.
- `mutation_pred_mlm`: Constructs mutation prediction scoring input for the model using ref/alt/mut pos
- `mutation_pred_likelihood`: Constructs input sentence with alt mutation at input to be scored by the model.
- `codon_sequence`: Constructs a codon sequence that can be inputed into the model.

**Available `--dataset_name` options:**
- `CodonMemmapDataset`: dataset to support memory-mapped pre-training dataset used for pre-training
- `MutationDataset`: dataset for mutation prediction
- `CodonBertDataset`: dataset to ingest codon sequences.

#### Fine-tuning
The publicly available checkpoints can be finetuned using the finetuning options.

**Available finetuning options:**
- `lora`: Fine-tunes low-rank adapters within a pretrained model added to each transformer layer to reduce training cost and memory usage.
- `head_only_random`: Trains a randomly initialized output head while the remainder of the model is kept frozen.
- `head_only_pretrained`: Trains a pretrained output head while the remainder of the model is kept frozen.
- `full`: Fine-tunes all parameters of the model end-to-end

This is an example commandline for running finetuning:

```bash
python -m src.runner finetune \
    --out_dir <output_dir> \
    --exp_name <experiment_name> \
    --model_name <model_size> \
    --pretrained_ckpt_path <path_to_pretrained_checkpoint> \
    --data_path <path_to_data> \
    --process_item <process-item-to-use> \
    --dataset_name <dataset-name> \
    --finetune_strategy <strategy>
```

#### Evaluation
The publicly available checkpoints can be used to launch evaluation runs as well.

**Available tasks**
- `mutation_prediction`: Scores a specified mutation via ref-vs-alt codon log-likelihood ratio.
- `masked_language_modeling`: Predicts masked codon tokens from surrounding sequence context.
- `fitness_prediction`: Estimates sequence fitness as the mean log-likelihood of the sequence as predicted by the model.
- `embedding_prediction`: Extracts encoder CLS embeddings for each input.
- `downstream_prediction`: Uses the downstream cross-attention head for task-specific classification/regression.

This is an example commandline for running evaluation:

```bash
python -m src.runner eval \
    --out_dir <output_dir> \
    --exp_name <experiment_name> \
    --model_name <model_size> \
    --checkpoint_path <path_to_checkpoint> \
    --data_path <path_to_data> \
    --task_type <task_type> \
    --predictions_output_dir <output_directory>
```

## Using Wandb with CodonFM

To use Wandb with CodonFM, set your Weights & Biases API key for logging in the .env file:

```bash
# WANDB key (optional; only needed if enabling --enable_wandb)
WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_api_key
```
You can then source the .env file.

```bash
source .env
```

When launching runs, enable WandB logging by passing `--enable_wandb` and providing `--project_name` and `--entity`. If these are omitted, WandB logging will be skipped.
